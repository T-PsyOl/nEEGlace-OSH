# nEEGlace-OpenHardware
## Overview
Studying the brain in real-world environments is essential for understanding natural neural activity. Traditional EEG systems are often bulky, uncomfortable, and limited to laboratory settings, and they lack contextual data, making long-term, naturalistic recordings challenging.

nEEGlace overcomes these limitations as a neck-worn, wearable EEG platform that records neural signals together with contextual data from integrated sensors. It is an Open Hardware project developed at the Translational Psychology Lab, University of Oldenburg.
